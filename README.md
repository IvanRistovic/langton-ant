## Description
Click **[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant)** for more information about Langton's Ant.

Click **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWBToaXK5T0)** to watch a cool video of this ant in action!

Coded in C# using Visual Studio 2017 RC.

## Installation
For now the only way to actually run the program is to download the project and import it into your Visual Studio.

When I finish, I will add an installer or something.

## Usage
To start the animation: File -> Start

Ant is placed by default in the middle of the field. You can set him where ever you like using right click.

You can randomly create a field, or even make one yourself! Use left click to flip colors of the field cells.

Don't like the field cell color? No problem. Choose one yourself! File -> Choose cell colors

## Known bugs
Why the need for bugs yet? I have only just started. Please report if you find any, though.
